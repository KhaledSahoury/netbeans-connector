NetBeans Chrome Connector (CRX) for auto-refresh with NetBeans.
This is a legacy extension using Manifest V2 and will not work on modern Chrome.
To use it, you need to install an older Google Chrome version that still supports Manifest V2.

You can download old versions of Chrome from this link: https://windows.apkpure.com/google-chrome/versions

You also need to install 7-Zip to extract the netbeans-chrome-connector.crx into a folder.

Then, in Chrome, go to Extensions → enable Developer mode → click on Load unpacked and select the extracted folder.
